# Web-Crawler-Web-Scraping-
Web Crawler &amp; Scraping Notes


Numerical and word / word groups were extracted from sites such as Tradingview and Amazon from the HTML directory based on Web 2.0. Scrapy, BS4 and Selenium examples are also included. Python was used in the scanning infrastructure. The codes are open version. A timer was added to the versions, but bot installation notes were not included. Additions will be uploaded periodically.

Microsoft Azure has been preferred for storage and Dashboard will be added when the database is completed.

Relevant contents were edited in July 2023 and last updated by Yasin Tosun from Siegen University in February 2024.

It is recommended to use Ruth for Web 3.0 migration and Gitopia or Radicle for pre-storage. Once the relevant updates are completed, you can access the version links here.

You are kindly requested to contact us for the use of relevant notes and full release notes.
